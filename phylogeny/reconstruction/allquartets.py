"""
All quartets method.

Given an n×n additive matrix M with n ≥ 5 associated to a 
binary tree T with positive branch lengths, we can construct
T using a two-step technique that we now describe. 

In Step 1, we compute a quartet tree on every four leaves by
applying the Four Point Method to each 4×4 submatrix of M. 

In Step 2, we assemble the quartet trees into a tree on the
full set of leaves. Step 1 is straightforward. The technique 
we use in Step 2 is called the “All Quartets Method”.
