An exploration on phylogenetic reconstruction algorithms.

In biological evolution one deals with entities that evolve in time.
Usually these entities can be represented by strings and the evolution
of these entities corresponds to changes in the corresponding string. For
example: 

- An organism may be represented by it's DNA sequence, 
- or by a list of characteristics it has 
- A protein can be represented by it's nucleotide sequence, 
- or by it's sequence of aminoacids.

Although the current package was developed with the above examples in
mind, one can think of other similar cases when it would be useful.

The algorithms are based, in part, by the ones found in the books:

-  **Algorithms on Strings, Trees, and Sequences.** by Dan Gusfield
-  **Computational Phylogenetics. An introduction to designing methods
   for phylogeny estimation.** by Tandy Warnow

Instalation

You can install the package from PyPI::

    $ pip install phylogeny


Trees, sequences and distance matrices
--------------------------------------

The main objects we consider are sequences, trees and matrices.

As mentioned before, the entities, represented as sequences, evolve
forming trees. At every point of the evolutive process, we can have
define a 'distance matrix', whose entries are the distance between
sequences (a measure of their dissimilarity).

In the phylogeny reconstruction problem, we generally start with a set
of sequences that evolved from a common ancestor, or their pairwise
distance matrix, and the task is to infer, with the help of certain
model assumptions, the tree that generated the evolutionary process.

The Cavender-Farris-Neyman model
--------------------------------

Given the nature of the reconstruction problem, an evolution model is
the guiding hand behind the inference process. The resulting tree
changes depending on the assumptions of the model.

A good model to study reconstruction algorithms is the
Cavender-Farris-Neymann (CFN) model, that consists of a random tree with
probabilities *p(e)* associated to every edge *e* of the tree. Under the CFN
model, every character of the sequence or 'trait' evolves down the tree
changing state on every edge according to the edge probability.

The library contains an implementation of the CFN stochastic tree model
for generating sequences from an ancestor.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from phylogeny.models import CFN_Tree
    
    # Create a new random tree with 5 leaves.
    >>> cfn = CFN_Tree(leaves=5)
    >>> print(cfn)

    >>> cfn.distance_matrix()

                    [1.7, 0. , 4.3, 3.8, 1.4],
                    [4.7, 4.3, 0. , 1.3, 2.9],
                    [4.2, 3.8, 1.3, 0. , 2.4],
                    [1.8, 1.4, 2.9, 2.4, 0. ]], names=(3, 4, 7, 8, 6))
                    


The clocklike evolution scenario
--------------------------------

The most simple case of evolution is the one in which the evolution is
clocklike, that is, that all branches have the same length (the mutation
rate is constant over time). In this case, at a certain time, the tree
generated has the property that the distance from the root to each leaf
is the same.

If one has an ultrametric distance matrix (which represents clocklike
evolution), then there are several algorithms to handle the
reconstruction, 2 of which are implemented in the library:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from phylogeny import DistanceMatrix
    
    # An ultrametric matrix
    >>> ultrametric = DistanceMatrix(
                            [[0, 8, 8, 5, 3],
                             [8, 0, 3, 8, 8],
                             [8, 3, 0, 8, 8],
                             [5, 8, 8, 0, 5],
                             [3, 8, 8, 5, 0] ],
                            names=['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E']
                        )



.. code-block:: python

    >>> from phylogeny.reconstruction import infer_clocklike_tree1
    
    >>> t = infer_clocklike_tree1(ultrametric)
    >>> print(t)
    
          /-B
       /-|
      |   \-C
    --|
      |      /-A
      |   /-|
       \-|   \-E
         |
          \-D



.. code-block:: python

    >>> from phylogeny.reconstruction import infer_clocklike_tree2
    
    >>> t = infer_clocklike_tree2(ultrametric)
    >>> print(t)
    
          /-D
       /-|
      |  |   /-A
      |   \-|
    --|      \-E
      |
      |   /-B
       \-|
          \-C


Clocklike reconstruction on the CFN model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now we can try to apply the clocklike assumption to a CFN model.

.. code-block:: python

    # Create a new random tree with 5 leaves.
    >>> cfn = CFN_Tree(leaves=5)
    >>> cfn.show()

.. image:: https://github.com/Ad115/Phylogeny/raw/master/assets/cfn_tree.png

.. code-block:: python

    # Evolve traits through the tree
    >>> sequences = cfn.evolve_traits([1]*10_000)
    
    # Get the distance matrix
    >>> distances = DistanceMatrix.from_sequences(sequences)
    
    # Infer the tree
    >>> t = infer_clocklike_tree1(distances)
    >>> print(t)
    
       /-8
    --|
      |   /-5
       \-|
         |   /-7
          \-|
            |   /-3
             \-|
                \-4


We can see that the different branch lengths from the root to each leaf
confuses the algorithm and we get a tree that is not correct. (The
reconstruction thus depends mostly on branch length, not on the topology
of the original tree)

Clocklike reconstruction for biological evolution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now we test the hypothesis on a simulation of biological microevolution.

.. code-block:: python

    # Download from PyPI:
    #     pip install cellsystem
    >>> from cellsystem import CellSystem
    
    # The cell system will simulate cell growth
    # while tracking the steps in that process.
    >>> system = CellSystem(init_genome='A'*70)
    
    # Initialize the first cell
    # in the middle of the grid
    >>> system.seed()
    
    
    # Take 20 steps forward in time
    >>> system.run(steps=5)
    
    # Stop logging the steps to the screen
    >>> system.log['printer'].silence()
    >>> system.run(steps=15)
 
::

    New cell 0 added @ (50, 50)
    Cell no. 0 migrating from site (50, 50) (father None)
    	New site: (51, 49)
    Cell no. 0 migrating from site (51, 49) (father None)
    	New site: (51, 48)
    Cell no. 0 dividing @ (51, 48)
    	New cells: 1 @ (52, 48) and 2 @ (51, 48)
    Cell no. 1 mutating @ site (52, 48) (father None)
    	Initial mutations: []
    	Initial genome: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
    	Final mutations: [(65, 'G')]
    	Final genome: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGAAAA


.. code-block:: python

    # Look at the real ancestry tree
    >>> t = system.log.ancestry(prune_death=True)
    >>> print(t)
    
          /-9
       /-|
      |   \-10
    --|
      |   /-7
       \-|
          \-8

          
    # Fetch the evolved DNA sequences
    >>> cell_sequences = {cell.index:cell.genome for cell in system['cells'].alive_cells}
    
    # Get the distance matrix
    >>> distances = DistanceMatrix.from_sequences(cell_sequences)
    
    # Inferr a tree under the clocklike assumption
    >>> t = infer_clocklike_tree1(distances)
    >>> print(t)
    
       /-10
    --|
      |   /-9
       \-|
         |   /-7
          \-|
             \-8


We can see it works better for this data, although it is not quite
there.

The reconstruction problem when evolution is not clocklike
----------------------------------------------------------

The reconstruction problem when evolution is not clocklike is so hard
that one can not even be sure of where the root of the tree goes!! So,
in the following, the trees will be fundamentally unrooted, that is, if
two trees differ only in the placement of the root, then we can say they
are equal.

The four point condition
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It must be noted that for every tree there is a distance matrix but not
any matrix correspond to a tree, the matrices that do are called
'additive'. A way to check if a matrix is additive is by checking the
**Four Point Condition**.

To explain the four point condition let's say we have the following
unrooted tree:

::

    1 -\    /- 3
        >--<
    2 -/    \- 4

Let the distance between leaves *a* and *b* be *D(a, b)*. Consider the
three following pairwise sums:

- *D(1, 2) + D(3, 4)*
- *D(1, 3) + D(2, 4)*
- *D(1, 4) + D(2, 3)*

The smallest of these sums has to be *D(1, 2) + D(3, 4)*, since it covers all
the edges of the tree connecting the four leaves, EXCEPT for the ones on
the path separating 1 and 2 from 3 and 4. Furthermore, the two larger of
the three pairwise sums have to be identical, since they cover the same
set of edges.

The **Four Point Condition** is the statement that the two largest
values of the three pairwise distance sums are the same.

The library contains a check for additivity based on the four point
condition:

.. code-block:: python

    # Let's take first a matrix that *is* additive
    # -- We take the matrix representation of a known tree.
    >>> distances = cfn.distance_matrix()
    >>> distances

    DistanceMatrix([[0. , 0.5, 3.1, 1.5, 1.6],
                    [0.5, 0. , 3.4, 1.7, 1.8],
                    [3.1, 3.4, 0. , 2.4, 2.5],
                    [1.5, 1.7, 2.4, 0. , 0.5],
                    [1.6, 1.8, 2.5, 0.5, 0. ]], names=(3, 4, 5, 7, 8))


    >>> print("Distance matrix is additive: ", distances.is_additive())
    
    >>> distances[2,3] += 1
    >>> print("Altered matrix is additive: ", distances.is_additive())

    Distance matrix is additive:  True
    Altered matrix is additive:  False


The four point method
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The four point method is based on the four point condition to
reconstruct a tree from a 4x4 distance matrix. We calculate the three
pairwise sums from the four point condition, we determine which of the
three pairwise sums is the smallest, and use that one to define the
split for the four leaves into two sets of two leaves each (remember
that if *D(1,2)+D(3,4)* is the smallest sum, then the induced tree must
be, in Newick notation, *((1,2),(3,4))*.)

.. code-block:: python

    # A test matrix to test the four-point method
    #    L1 -\    /- L2
    #         >--<
    #    L3 -/    \- L4
    >>> additive = DistanceMatrix([[0, 3,  6,  7],
                                   [3, 0,  7,  6],
                                   [6, 7,  0, 11],
                                   [7, 6, 11,  0]], names=['L1', 'L2', 'L3', 'L4'])

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from phylogeny.reconstruction import four_point_method
        
    >>> tree = four_point_method(additive, names=additive.names)
    >>> print(f"The associated tree is: {tree}")

    The associated tree is: 
          /-L1
       /-|
      |   \-L3
    --|
      |   /-L2
       \-|
          \-L4


The all quartets method
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The all quartets method results from the repeated application of the
four points method and is useful to reconstruct larger trees.

Given an *nÃ—n* additive matrix *M* with *n â‰¥ 5* associated to a binary tree *T*
with positive branch lengths, we can construct *T* using a two-step
technique that we now describe.

In Step 1, we compute a quartet tree on every four leaves by applying
the Four Point Method to each 4Ã—4 submatrix of *M*.

In Step 2, we assemble the quartet trees into a tree on the full set of
leaves. Step 1 is straightforward. The technique we use in Step 2 is
called the **All Quartets Method**.

.. code-block:: python

    # We start with a known tree
    >>> cfn = CFN_Tree(leaves=5)
    >>> print(cfn)
